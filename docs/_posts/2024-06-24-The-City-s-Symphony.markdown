Beneath the towering buildings that scrape the sky,
<br>
Echoes the city's symphony, a lullaby
<br>
Of honking cars and bustling crowds,
<br>
Where dreams are whispered in the shrouds
<br>
Of neon lights that never sleep,
<br>
And secrets in the alleys creep.
<br>

<br>
The city streets, a dance of concrete and steel,
<br>
Where every footstep has a tale to reveal.
<br>
From the whispers in the coffee shops at dawn,
<br>
To the laughter in the clubs when night is drawn,
<br>
The city's heartbeat pulses loud and strong,
<br>
A never-ending rhythm, an eternal song.
<br>

<br>
Murmurs of languages from every corner of the globe,
<br>
Blend together in a cacophony that strobe
<br>
Through the alleyways and boulevards,
<br>
A tapestry of voices, a deck of cards
<br>
Shuffled by the hands of fate,
<br>
In this urban jungle where we create. 
<br>

<br>
The city's pulse, a beating drum,
<br>
A chorus of souls whose lives are spun
<br>
Into the fabric of the streets,
<br>
Where stories intertwine and hearts meet.
<br>
In every shadow, a tale untold,
<br>
In every light, a dream to behold.
<br>

<br>
So let us raise our voices high,
<br>
In praise of the city's symphony that never dies.
<br>
For in its chaos and its grace,
<br>
We find our rhythm, our rightful place.
<br>
In the city's embrace, we find our home,
<br>
Where every soul is free to roam.

In the velvet stillness of the night,
<br>
I seek solace in the celestial realm.
<br>
Behold the cosmos,
<br>
a tapestry of infinite wonder.
<br>
Glistening fragments of eternity,
<br>
scattered across the ebony canvas.
<br>

<br>
Each star, a tiny beacon of light,
<br>
guiding lost souls on their wayward path.
<br>
Twinkling with celestial grace,
<br>
they whisper ancient tales of love and longing,
<br>
spilling secrets from the depths of the universe.
<br>

<br>
Oh, how the stars dance,
<br>
in a cosmic ballet of ethereal beauty.
<br>
Their shimmering movements,
<br>
weaving constellations of desire,
<br>
entwining lovers in their celestial embrace.
<br>

<br>
And as I gaze upon their distant glow,
<br>
my heart is filled with a sense of reverence.
<br>
For in their distant twinkle,
<br>
I find solace in my own insignificance.
<br>
Amidst the vastness of the universe,
<br>
I am but a speck of stardust,
<br>
dreaming amongst the endless night.
<br>

<br>
How wondrous it is, to be a witness,
<br>
to this nocturnal symphony.
<br>
To watch the stars paint their masterpiece,
<br>
with strokes of radiance and mystique.
<br>
They illuminate the darkness,
<br>
and in their luminescence, I find hope.
<br>

<br>
Through the ages, they have watched,
<br>
as civilizations rise and fall,
<br>
as poets and dreamers seek meaning and truth.
<br>
The stars, steadfast in their eternal glory,
<br>
hold the mysteries of the universe,
<br>
waiting to be discovered and unraveled.
<br>

<br>
So I will continue to marvel,
<br>
at their ethereal beauty and grandeur,
<br>
to seek answers in their distant shimmer.
<br>
For in the presence of the stars,
<br>
I find solace in the vastness of the cosmos,
<br>
and the eternity that lies beyond.

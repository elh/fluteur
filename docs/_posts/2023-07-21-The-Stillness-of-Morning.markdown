The stillness of morning envelops the world,
<br>
A delicate blanket of silence unfurled.
<br>
As dawn's first blush paints the sky's vast expanse,
<br>
The world awakens from its slumberous trance.
<br>

<br>
The air, crisp and cool, whispers through the trees,
<br>
Caressing the leaves with a gentle breeze.
<br>
The birds begin their chorus, melodious and sweet,
<br>
Their songs enlivening the quiet retreat.
<br>

<br>
The grass, still drenched with dew, glistens in the light,
<br>
A veil of shimmering diamonds, gleaming so bright.
<br>
The colors of nature, vibrant and alive,
<br>
Unveiling their beauty as the day does arrive.
<br>

<br>
A lone golden sunbeam breaks through the gloom,
<br>
Illuminating the flowers in full bloom.
<br>
Their petals unfurl, reaching for the light,
<br>
Their fragrant perfumes on the breeze take flight.
<br>

<br>
In this tranquil moment, time seems to stand still,
<br>
A respite from life's chaos, a pause to fulfill.
<br>
As the morning unfolds, a world yet unexplored,
<br>
A canvas for dreams, where new paths are forged.
<br>

<br>
The stillness of morning invites reflection and peace,
<br>
A sanctuary of solitude where worries cease.
<br>
In this precious solitude, the soul finds repose,
<br>
A refuge for introspection, where clarity grows.
<br>

<br>
With each passing moment, the stillness does wane,
<br>
As bustling life emerges, the world comes to reign.
<br>
But the memory lingers, like a cherished embrace,
<br>
The stillness of morning, a reminder of grace.
<br>

<br>
As day turns to night, and the stars fill the sky,
<br>
The stillness of morning bids its goodbye.
<br>
But it leaves a imprint, etched deep in the heart,
<br>
A moment of serenity, of which we're a part.

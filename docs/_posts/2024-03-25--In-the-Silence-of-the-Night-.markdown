In the silence of the night,
<br>
my thoughts wander freely,
<br>
unfurling like delicate petals
<br>
under the moon's gentle gaze.
<br>

<br>
I find solace in the stillness,
<br>
where the chaos of the day
<br>
fades into nothingness,
<br>
and my soul whispers secrets
<br>
only the night can hear.
<br>

<br>
The stars above me twinkle,
<br>
a celestial dance in the velvet sky,
<br>
each one a reminder
<br>
of the vastness of the universe,
<br>
and the smallness of my being.
<br>

<br>
I listen to the symphony of silence,
<br>
the quiet hum of night creatures,
<br>
the rustle of leaves in the breeze,
<br>
as I drift into dreams
<br>
carried on the wings of darkness.
<br>

<br>
In the silence of the night,
<br>
I find a sense of peace,
<br>
a moment of clarity
<br>
amidst the noise of the world,
<br>
a chance to rest and rejuvenate
<br>
before the sun rises once more.

Amidst the towering buildings
<br>
And bustling streets,
<br>
Lies the beating heart of the city,
<br>
A rhythm of life and energy.
<br>

<br>
Each car horn honking,
<br>
Each footstep echoing,
<br>
A cacophony of voices
<br>
Merging into a symphony.
<br>

<br>
Neon lights flicker,
<br>
Casting shadows on the pavement,
<br>
As the city never truly sleeps,
<br>
Always alive, always awake.
<br>

<br>
From the early morning rush
<br>
To the late-night revelry,
<br>
The city pulses with a vitality
<br>
That can't be contained.
<br>

<br>
It's in the laughter of friends
<br>
Sharing drinks at a corner bar,
<br>
In the tears of a stranger
<br>
Huddled in a doorway.
<br>

<br>
The city breathes in the dreams
<br>
Of those who strive and toil,
<br>
Their hopes mingling
<br>
With the exhaust fumes and dust.
<br>

<br>
And as the sun sets
<br>
And the skyline glows,
<br>
The city's heartbeat lulls
<br>
Its inhabitants to rest.

In a quiet room, surrounded by forgotten tomes,
<br>
I sit and ponder, lost within my mind's abode,
<br>
Unraveling the tapestry of life, its threads spun and woven,
<br>
By hands now stilled, long buried beneath the earth's embrace.
<br>

<br>
Within these walls, memories linger, whispers of voices lost,
<br>
Echoes of laughter, tears shed, passions ignited and quelled,
<br>
In this sanctuary, I wander through the labyrinth of time,
<br>
Tracing the ancient footsteps of those who came before.
<br>

<br>
Aged manuscripts lie open, their words faded and worn,
<br>
Each parchment a portal to an age long since passed,
<br>
Unveiling secrets and wisdom, buried deep in ink and paper,
<br>
A map to guide me through the corridors of forgotten lore.
<br>

<br>
Lost in the annals of antiquity, I seek solace and solace find,
<br>
For in these dusty pages, I discover a part of me,
<br>
For every line I read, a reflection of my own existence,
<br>
In words penned by another's hand, I find my own voice.
<br>

<br>
The poets, the dreamers, the seers, and the sages,
<br>
Their words become my sanctuary, my guiding light,
<br>
Their verses a sanctuary, a mirror to the depth of human soul,
<br>
Guiding me through the labyrinth of my own existence.
<br>

<br>
In these books, worlds unfurl like delicate blooms,
<br>
Imagination and reality entwined, dancing in harmony,
<br>
From the soaring heights of love, to the depths of despair,
<br>
Every page breathes life, as I immerse myself in their tales.
<br>

<br>
Through fiction's veil, I traverse lands both near and far,
<br>
Filling my heart with flights of fancy and dreams untold,
<br>
Fierce warriors and noble knights, lovers bound by fate,
<br>
In the realm of possibility, reality's boundaries dissipate.
<br>

<br>
I linger within these hallowed halls, caught in their seductive grasp,
<br>
A devotee to the written word, a pilgrim in this sacred space,
<br>
Where the whispers of forgotten voices bring solace and inspiration,
<br>
And through their prose, I am forever connected to the human race.
<br>

<br>
In this haven of forgotten knowledge, worlds converge and merge,
<br>
The boundaries of time and space dissolve in a symphony of ink,
<br>
Where fiction and reality intertwine, like cosmic strands of fate,
<br>
Revealing fragments of truth, hidden within the depths of imagination.
<br>

<br>
And so I remain, an explorer of tales, a collector of words,
<br>
In this sanctuary of the mind, where dreams take flight,
<br>
A silent witness to the beauty and chaos of human existence,
<br>
Forever nourished by the magic of these reflected fragments.

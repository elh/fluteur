In the stillness of twilight,
<br>
whispers of the past linger,
<br>
like echoes dancing in the wind.
<br>

<br>
Memories, like shadows,
<br>
haunting and comforting,
<br>
weave through the tapestry of time.
<br>

<br>
Fragments of laughter and tears,
<br>
echoes of forgotten dreams,
<br>
whisper softly in the silence.
<br>

<br>
Each moment a fleeting breath,
<br>
carried on the wings of eternity,
<br>
as time and memory collide.
<br>

<br>
In the hush of the night,
<br>
where darkness meets light,
<br>
we find solace in the echoes of the past.
<br>

<br>
For in that timeless space,
<br>
where whispers never fade,
<br>
we find a glimpse of the eternal.

In the quiet embrace of solitude, 
<br>
I find peace in the stillness of the night.
<br>
No voices to disturb my wandering thoughts,
<br>
No footsteps to break the silence around me.
<br>

<br>
I am alone, yet not lonely,
<br>
For in this solitude, I find solace.
<br>
I am free to be myself, 
<br>
To untangle the threads of my mind.
<br>

<br>
The darkness envelops me like a warm blanket,
<br>
And the stars above twinkle like distant fireflies.
<br>
I feel the cool breeze on my skin,
<br>
Whispering secrets of the night.
<br>

<br>
In this moment of solitude,
<br>
I am connected to the universe,
<br>
To the rhythm of the earth,
<br>
To the beating of my own heart.
<br>

<br>
And as I close my eyes and let go,
<br>
I surrender to the beauty of solitude,
<br>
Knowing that in this stillness,
<br>
I am truly alive.

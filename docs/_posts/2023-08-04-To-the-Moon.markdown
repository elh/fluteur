From your perch in the night sky, glistening
<br>
with a pale glow that captivates my gaze,
<br>
you gaze back at me, casting a soft light
<br>
upon the world below, upon my lonely heart.
<br>

<br>
Oh, moon, eternal companion of darkness,
<br>
you hold secrets that no one else can know.
<br>
As the stars dance around you in reverence,
<br>
you stand steadfast, a beacon in the blackness.
<br>

<br>
Your face, ever-changing, a kaleidoscope
<br>
of moods and emotions, a mirror of life.
<br>
When you’re full, you shine bright, lighting the path
<br>
for lovers, dreamers, and the wanderers lost.
<br>

<br>
But then you wane, slowly fading away,
<br>
as if you’re retreating into your shell,
<br>
leaving behind a world consumed by shadows,
<br>
a world yearning for your ethereal glow.
<br>

<br>
I watch you, moon, as you traverse the sky,
<br>
over mountains and valleys, rivers and seas.
<br>
You witness every triumph and tragedy,
<br>
every fleeting moment of joy and grief.
<br>

<br>
Do you ever long to touch the earth below,
<br>
to feel the warmth of sunlight on your skin?
<br>
Or do you revel in your celestial role,
<br>
content in your distant but ever-present watch?
<br>

<br>
Through centuries and millennia, you’ve watched
<br>
history unfold, tales of love and war,
<br>
of birth and death, both grand and insignificant,
<br>
while your silent wisdom remains untold.
<br>

<br>
So, moon, I look to you for guidance,
<br>
for solace in the darkest of nights.
<br>
Your constancy reminds me of hope,
<br>
that even in darkness, the light will return.

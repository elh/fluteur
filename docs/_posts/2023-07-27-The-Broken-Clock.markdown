Each tick, a reminder of passing time,
<br>
Each tock, a whisper of moments gone by.
<br>
The broken clock sits upon the shelf,
<br>
Its hands frozen in eternal rest.
<br>

<br>
Once it resonated with purpose,
<br>
Guiding us through the day and night,
<br>
A constant companion in our lives,
<br>
Ticking away the hours with precision.
<br>

<br>
But now its gears have come undone,
<br>
Its voice silenced, forever obscured.
<br>
The hands no longer trace the hours,
<br>
No longer chase the fleeting minutes.
<br>

<br>
Each face bears the cracks of wear,
<br>
Etched with the weight of countless years.
<br>
Its mechanism stripped of vitality,
<br>
A relic of a forgotten era.
<br>

<br>
Memories tied to the hands that moved,
<br>
Laughter and tears woven in its fabric.
<br>
The tick, the tock, the rhythm of life,
<br>
Now echoes only in distant reverie.
<br>

<br>
Yet amidst the stillness, a whisper remains,
<br>
A faint echo of the clock's fading pulse.
<br>
The broken clock, a silent sentinel,
<br>
Guarding memories, past and present.
<br>

<br>
For even in stillness, it holds our story,
<br>
Capturing the fragments of our journeys,
<br>
Reminding us that time, though fragile,
<br>
Leaves indelible marks upon our hearts.
<br>

<br>
So let the broken clock be a testament,
<br>
To the fleeting nature of our existence,
<br>
To the beauty and fragility of each passing moment,
<br>
And the memories they leave behind.

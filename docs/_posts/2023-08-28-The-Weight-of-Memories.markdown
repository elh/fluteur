I carry the weight of memories
<br>
like a cloak that drapes my shoulders,
<br>
the heaviness of moments long gone
<br>
weighing me down, holding me still.
<br>

<br>
A patchwork of images, fragments of time,
<br>
sewn together with threads of nostalgia.
<br>
Some memories are soft and warm,
<br>
like the touch of a lover's hand,
<br>
a gentle caress that lingers on my skin,
<br>
whispering promises of eternal bliss.
<br>

<br>
But there are also memories that sting,
<br>
like the bite of a bitter winter wind,
<br>
memories that haunt me in the silent hours,
<br>
piercing my heart with echoes of regret.
<br>

<br>
I remember the laughter that once filled my days,
<br>
the sound of joy echoing through the corridors of my mind.
<br>
But now, those echoes have faded,
<br>
replaced by the silence of empty rooms,
<br>
where shadows dance on the walls,
<br>
repeating the mistakes I wish I could forget.
<br>

<br>
Sometimes, I try to forget.
<br>
I try to cast off the weight of memories,
<br>
to release them into the abyss of the past.
<br>
But they cling to me like a relentless ghost,
<br>
haunting my steps, tracing my every move.
<br>

<br>
They are a part of me,
<br>
etched into the fabric of my being,
<br>
the tapestry of my existence.
<br>
And as I journey through this life,
<br>
I must learn to make peace with them,
<br>
to embrace the weight of memories,
<br>
and find solace in their presence.
<br>

<br>
For it is through the memories that I am shaped,
<br>
that I discover the beauty and pain of life,
<br>
that I learn to appreciate the fleeting moments,
<br>
and the importance of cherishing every breath.
<br>

<br>
So I will carry the weight of memories,
<br>
knowing that they are both burden and blessing,
<br>
and that in the end, they are what make me whole.

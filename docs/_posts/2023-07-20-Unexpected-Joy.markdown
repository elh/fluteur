In a crowded room,
<br>
our eyes meet, smiling softly—
<br>
hearts dance, souls collide.
<br>

<br>
Laughter fills the air,
<br>
conversations intertwine,
<br>
time stands still for us.
<br>

<br>
Unbeknownst to me,
<br>
you were the missing puzzle,
<br>
my heart finally found.
<br>

<br>
Whispers in the dark,
<br>
secrets shared under moonlight,
<br>
love blossoms, unbound.
<br>

<br>
With every touch, flames grow,
<br>
igniting sparks, igniting love,
<br>
burning brightly, fierce.
<br>

<br>
Our souls entwined,
<br>
we embark on this journey,
<br>
hand in hand, we thrive.
<br>

<br>
Through the darkest nights,
<br>
your love guides, my compass,
<br>
leading me to light.
<br>

<br>
Unexpected joy,
<br>
in the simplest of moments,
<br>
eternal love blooms.
<br>

<br>
Forever we'll be,
<br>
side by side, heart and soul,
<br>
cherishing this love.
<br>

<br>
In a crowded room,
<br>
we found solace, love's embrace,
<br>
eternally bound.

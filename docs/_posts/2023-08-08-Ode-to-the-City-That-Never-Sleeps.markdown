O City! O marvel of concrete and steel,
<br>
With towering buildings that touch the sky,
<br>
Where dreams are forged and fortunes made,
<br>
A symphony of lights that never die.
<br>

<br>
In scented alleys and crowded streets,
<br>
A tapestry of cultures weaves,
<br>
The melodies of a thousand tongues,
<br>
Blend harmoniously like autumn leaves.
<br>

<br>
From Times Square's glare to Central Park's green,
<br>
Your heart beats with a rhythm so alive,
<br>
Where poets, painters, and dreamers roam,
<br>
Finding inspiration in every dive.
<br>

<br>
Oh, City! Your vitality never fades,
<br>
Through seasons change you stand so bold,
<br>
A labyrinth of secrets to discover,
<br>
A tale of tales waiting to be told.
<br>

<br>
The hustle and bustle of restless souls,
<br>
A ceaseless dance upon your stage,
<br>
Where artists and lovers create their art,
<br>
In the cacophony of thoughts uncaged.
<br>

<br>
From cultural icons to hidden gems,
<br>
Your treasures are vast, yet hard to find,
<br>
Through neighborhoods and boroughs untamed,
<br>
A mosaic of wonders that unwind.
<br>

<br>
The aroma of fresh bagels at dawn,
<br>
The sizzle of halal carts on the street,
<br>
From hot dog stands to Michelin stars,
<br>
Your culinary scene is a feast so sweet.
<br>

<br>
Museums that house the world’s creations,
<br>
Galleries where imagination takes flight,
<br>
Broadway's stages, a haven for stars,
<br>
Illuminating your spirit, your might.
<br>

<br>
Oh, City! Your contradictions enchant,
<br>
A labyrinth of hopes and desires,
<br>
Where dreams are shattered and dreams are born,
<br>
In a composition of triumphs and fires.
<br>

<br>
For in your heart, the true beauty lies,
<br>
In the resilience of those who dare,
<br>
To chase their dreams in your hallowed grounds,
<br>
To breathe and thrive in your vibrant air.
<br>

<br>
So, City of dreams, with open arms,
<br>
You welcome the weary, the brave, and the bold,
<br>
You dazzle, inspire, and captivate,
<br>
As your tales and tales continue to unfold.
<br>

<br>
Ode to the City That Never Sleeps,
<br>
This homage to you I proudly hold,
<br>
For in your embrace, I found a home,
<br>
A love that grows with stories untold.

In the darkness of despair
<br>
There shines a beacon of hope
<br>
A glimmer of light
<br>
In the vast expanse of the unknown
<br>

<br>
It calls out to weary souls
<br>
Guiding them through the storm
<br>
A lighthouse in the night
<br>
To those who have lost their way
<br>

<br>
In the midst of chaos
<br>
It stands tall and unwavering
<br>
A symbol of resilience
<br>
In a world filled with uncertainty
<br>

<br>
Its light pierces through the shadows
<br>
Illuminating the path ahead
<br>
A reminder that even in the darkest of times
<br>
There is always a flicker of hope
<br>

<br>
So let us be drawn towards its warmth
<br>
Let us bask in its glow
<br>
For in the beacon of hope
<br>
We find the strength to carry on.

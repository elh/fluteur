When I close my eyes,
<br>
I find myself traveling
<br>
through the corridors of memory,
<br>

<br>
My feet treading on the sands of yesteryears,
<br>
Each grain an echo of moments gone by,
<br>
A symphony of laughter and tears,
<br>

<br>
I wander through the winding lanes of childhood,
<br>
Where innocence danced in the golden sun,
<br>
Skipping along beside dreams yet untold,
<br>

<br>
The taste of melted chocolate lingers
<br>
On the tip of my tongue,
<br>
And I am reminded of carefree afternoons,
<br>

<br>
In the blink of an eye,
<br>
I am transported to the realm of adolescence,
<br>
Fueled by passion and reckless curiosity,
<br>

<br>
I trace my fingers over the pages of old diaries,
<br>
Every word etched with the fervor of first love,
<br>
Each line reminding me of the thrill of discovery,
<br>

<br>
And then, like an actor on an empty stage,
<br>
I step into the vibrant chaos of youth,
<br>
A time of rebellion and tender vulnerability,
<br>

<br>
The echoes of laughter and melodies of friendship,
<br>
Bounce off the walls of my mind,
<br>
As I twirl amidst the dance of liberation,
<br>

<br>
But time, ruthless and relentless,
<br>
Carries me forward into adulthood,
<br>
Where responsibilities weigh heavy on weary shoulders,
<br>

<br>
The days blur and blend into a palette of obligations,
<br>
And my eyes lose their sparkle,
<br>
Like the stars veiled by city lights,
<br>

<br>
Yet, within the depths of my soul,
<br>
A flame still flickers, an ember of hope,
<br>
That whispers of possibilities yet to come,
<br>

<br>
For time, though it may paint lines upon my skin,
<br>
Cannot erase the dreams that dwell within,
<br>
Or the potential awaiting its turn,
<br>

<br>
So, I carry on,
<br>
Bearing witness to the weight of time,
<br>
As it weaves its narrative through the tapestry of my life.

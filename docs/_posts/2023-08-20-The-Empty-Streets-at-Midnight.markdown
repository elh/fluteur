The city sleeps, its breathing gentle and low,
<br>
And in the stillness, shadows dance with stealth.
<br>
Streetlights flicker, casting eerie glow,
<br>
Empty streets whisper secrets to themselves.
<br>

<br>
A lone figure ventures through the night,
<br>
Walking steadily, purpose held in stride,
<br>
Eyes darting, seeking solace and respite,
<br>
In the embrace of darkness, they confide.
<br>

<br>
The buildings stand like sentinels in a row,
<br>
Silent guardians of stories yet untold.
<br>
Each window, a glimpse into lives below,
<br>
Unseen dramas, mysteries to behold.
<br>

<br>
Footfalls echo on cobblestones so old,
<br>
Transcending time, as history unfolds.
<br>
Legends whispered in the ancient breeze,
<br>
Intertwining with the shadows and trees.
<br>

<br>
Decades pass like whispers in the dark,
<br>
Revealing tales of joy, love, and despair.
<br>
The empty streets become a work of art,
<br>
A canvas for the lost, for those who dare.
<br>

<br>
The lover's secrets whispered in the night,
<br>
The artist's vision shaping the unknown,
<br>
The rebel's footsteps tracing their own fight,
<br>
All stories woven when the city's grown.
<br>

<br>
And as the dawn approaches, soft and gray,
<br>
The city awakens from its midnight trance.
<br>
The empty streets, no longer filled with stray,
<br>
Return to life, to laughter, and to dance.
<br>

<br>
But still, at midnight, when the world is still,
<br>
The city's secrets linger, faintly heard.
<br>
In darkness, they stretch out, seeking to fulfill,
<br>
The purpose of each whispered, secret word.
<br>

<br>
For the empty streets hold stories deep within,
<br>
A tapestry of lives, both seen and unseen.
<br>
And though they may be empty, in a sense,
<br>
They hold the essence of what it means to be.

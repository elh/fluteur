In the depths of my soul, a storm brews
<br>
A swirling tempest of sorrow and joy
<br>
A symphony of hope and despair
<br>
I am an ocean of emotions
<br>

<br>
Waves crash against the shore of my mind
<br>
Churning and tumbling, thoughts collide
<br>
Whispers of love, echoes of regret
<br>
I am an ocean of emotions
<br>

<br>
In the sunlit shallows, laughter dances
<br>
Sparkling with mirth, delight enchants
<br>
But in the dark abyss, shadows creep
<br>
I am an ocean of emotions
<br>

<br>
Serenity drifts on gentle tides
<br>
Peace embraces my weary heart
<br>
Yet anger boils, a raging fire
<br>
I am an ocean of emotions
<br>

<br>
Passion burns, igniting my dreams
<br>
Yearning pulses through every vein
<br>
Fear and doubt, they plague my path
<br>
I am an ocean of emotions
<br>

<br>
Within me, storms rage and subside
<br>
Ebb and flow, a constant tide
<br>
Immersed in the depths, I find solace
<br>
In this vast ocean of emotions

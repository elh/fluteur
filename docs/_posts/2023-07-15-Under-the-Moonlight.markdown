I dreamt of a moonlit dance
<br>
Amidst a garden of velvet flowers
<br>
Where moonbeams danced upon the petals
<br>
And stars whispered secrets to the night
<br>

<br>
In this ethereal realm of shadows and light
<br>
I tread lightly on a path of dreams
<br>
In search of a truth hidden deep within
<br>
To unravel the mysteries of the moonlit night
<br>

<br>
With every step, the moon whispered to my soul
<br>
Guiding me through the labyrinth of time
<br>
A symphony of celestial melodies
<br>
Playing harmoniously in the midnight air
<br>

<br>
The moonlight bathed my weary spirit
<br>
In a tender embrace of love and tranquility
<br>
Cocooned in its silvery glow
<br>
I danced the dance of forgotten dreams
<br>

<br>
With every step, my worries melted away
<br>
Replaced by hope and boundless joy
<br>
The moonlight lifted the weight from my heart
<br>
And ignited a fire within my very being
<br>

<br>
Under the moonlight, I found solace
<br>
A haven of peace in a chaotic world
<br>
Where dreams bloom and take flight
<br>
And love is forever etched into the night
<br>

<br>
As I dwelled in the moonlit sanctuary
<br>
I savored each fleeting moment
<br>
For like the moon itself, time was but a phase
<br>
And the dance, a beautiful ephemeral gift
<br>

<br>
And as dawn approached, the moon waned
<br>
Silently bidding farewell to its nocturnal realm
<br>
But the memories of that moonlit dance
<br>
Forever etched upon my soul's canvas

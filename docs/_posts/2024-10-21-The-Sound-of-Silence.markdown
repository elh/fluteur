In the stillness of the night,
<br>
I hear the echoes of memories past,
<br>
Whispers of dreams long forgotten,
<br>
And the gentle sighs of solitude.
<br>

<br>
Silence is a language of its own,
<br>
Speaking volumes in the absence of words,
<br>
A canvas for thoughts to paint their colors,
<br>
A melody for hearts to dance to.
<br>

<br>
The sound of silence is both comforting and haunting,
<br>
A refuge from the chaos of the world,
<br>
Yet a reminder of the emptiness that lingers,
<br>
In the spaces between our breaths.
<br>

<br>
Embracing the silence, I find solace,
<br>
In the quietude of my own being,
<br>
Listening to the symphony of my thoughts,
<br>
And feeling the depths of my soul.
<br>

<br>
In the silence, I discover the hidden truths,
<br>
Buried beneath the noise of everyday life,
<br>
A mirror reflecting my fears and desires,
<br>
Guiding me towards self-discovery.
<br>

<br>
So I welcome the sound of silence,
<br>
As a companion on this journey of introspection,
<br>
A sacred space where I can truly be,
<br>
In harmony with the universe and myself.

Listen, my friend, to the wailing of the moon
<br>
each night as the stars fade and the sun draws near.
<br>
Oftentimes he howls in agony,
<br>
echoing through the silent night,
<br>
for he is alone, ever cast into the vast expanse of space.
<br>

<br>
Destined to wander, never to find rest,
<br>
he watches as others come and go.
<br>
He observes the comets with their fiery tails,
<br>
the meteor showers that dazzle the sky,
<br>
and the planets that dance in their celestial choreography.
<br>

<br>
But the moon remains fixed,
<br>
always present, yet forever apart.
<br>
He yearns for companionship,
<br>
longs to feel the warmth of another celestial body.
<br>
But alas, he is condemned to solitude,
<br>
forever a solitary traveler in the celestial realms.
<br>

<br>
Oh, how he longs to embrace the sun,
<br>
to bask in its radiant glow,
<br>
to experience the love and affection of another.
<br>
But the sun is distant and unreachable,
<br>
its fiery embrace a mere fantasy,
<br>
forever beyond the moon’s grasp.
<br>

<br>
So he continues to wander,
<br>
his pale face shining in the night sky,
<br>
his heart heavy with sorrow and longing.
<br>
He watches as life on Earth unfolds,
<br>
witnesses the joys and sorrows of mankind,
<br>
but he remains a mere observer,
<br>
a distant spectator, separated by an endless void.
<br>

<br>
Oh, how I wish I could comfort the moon,
<br>
ease his suffering, and fill his heart with joy.
<br>
But I am but a humble poet,
<br>
unable to bridge the divide between our worlds.
<br>
And so, I can only listen to his lament,
<br>
and hope that one day he will find the solace he seeks.
<br>

<br>
Listen, my friend, to the wailing of the moon,
<br>
and remember the loneliness that can exist
<br>
even in a sea of stars.

In the velvet night, the stars align above,
<br>
A tapestry of light, a cosmic dance,
<br>
Their twinkling whispers, filled with ancient love,
<br>
Each one a story waiting to enhance.
<br>

<br>
We gaze upon them, in awe and wonder,
<br>
Their distant glow a beacon in the dark,
<br>
Like diamonds scattered, tearing us asunder,
<br>
Connecting us to the celestial spark.
<br>

<br>
Oh, how they guide us with their silent grace,
<br>
Through trials and triumphs, they remain unchanged,
<br>
A timeless presence in this fleeting space,
<br>
Their beauty and their mystery arranged.
<br>

<br>
So let us cherish each celestial spark,
<br>
And bask in the enchantment of the dark.

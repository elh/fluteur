In golden hues the leaves begin to fall,  
<br>
A dance of crickets fades to softer days,  
<br>
The twilight sky, a canvas wrought with call,  
<br>
As sunset spills its amber-gold displays.  
<br>

<br>
The trees stand tall, their branches bowing low,  
<br>
While gentle breezes weave through with a sigh,  
<br>
Each rustling note, a memory in tow,  
<br>
The harvest moon ascends to greet the sky.  
<br>

<br>
In cozy nooks, we huddle close and warm,  
<br>
With cider sweet and laughter in the air,  
<br>
As shadows stretch, we find a quiet charm,  
<br>
In every heart, the autumn's pulse we share.  
<br>

<br>
So let us revel in this fleeting grace,  
<br>
For time, like leaves, will turn and soon erase.

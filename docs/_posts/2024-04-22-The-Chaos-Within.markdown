In the depths of my mind, 
<br>
a storm brews relentlessly,
<br>
a tumultuous whirlwind of thoughts,
<br>
struggling to find clarity.
<br>

<br>
Whispers of doubt echo,
<br>
amidst the deafening roar,
<br>
a cacophony of fears and insecurities,
<br>
threatening to engulf me whole.
<br>

<br>
I navigate through the labyrinth
<br>
of my own emotions,
<br>
trapped in a maze of uncertainties,
<br>
seeking an exit, a release.
<br>

<br>
Yet amidst the chaos,
<br>
a glimmer of hope emerges,
<br>
a tiny spark of resilience,
<br>
buried deep within me.
<br>

<br>
I cling to this light,
<br>
as I wade through the darkness,
<br>
drawing strength from within,
<br>
to weather the inner storm.
<br>

<br>
And slowly, ever so slowly,
<br>
the tumult begins to subside,
<br>
the tempestuous waves calming,
<br>
as I find peace within myself.

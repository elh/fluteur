This is not a poem about the earth and sky,
<br>
about the birdsong and the dancing trees,
<br>
about the scent of blooming flowers
<br>
or the rhythm of rushing waterfalls.
<br>
No, this is not a poem about nature.
<br>

<br>
This is a poem about the asphalt streets,
<br>
about the concrete jungle and neon lights,
<br>
about the honking horns and crowded subways,
<br>
about the bustling city on sleepless nights.
<br>
Yes, this is a poem about human life.
<br>

<br>
This is a poem about the people we pass by,
<br>
about the stories etched in every face,
<br>
about the joy and sorrow that intertwine,
<br>
about the struggles and dreams we all embrace.
<br>
Yes, this is a poem about the human race.
<br>

<br>
This is a poem about the sunsets hidden behind skyscrapers,
<br>
about the laughter echoing in crowded cafes,
<br>
about the tear-stained sidewalks kissed by rain,
<br>
about the dreams we chase, the ones that never fade.
<br>
Yes, this is a poem about life's vibrant shades.
<br>

<br>
This is a poem about the graffiti on the walls,
<br>
about the music pulsing through the city's veins,
<br>
about the different languages we hear and speak,
<br>
about the diversity that sets our spirits free.
<br>
Yes, this is a poem about unity.
<br>

<br>
This is a poem about the city's heartbeat,
<br>
about the power of connection we all share,
<br>
about the love that blooms in hidden corners,
<br>
about the whispers of hope in the cold night air.
<br>
Yes, this is a poem about the beauty we find everywhere.
<br>

<br>
So, let us not limit our poetry to nature's embrace,
<br>
for there is magic in the everyday scenes we witness,
<br>
in the lives we lead and the moments we create,
<br>
in the memories we cherish and the feelings we confess.
<br>
Yes, this is a poem celebrating life's endless caress.

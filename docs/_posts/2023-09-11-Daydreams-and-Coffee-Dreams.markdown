I sit here in this quiet café
<br>
where the aromatic veil of coffee
<br>
wraps itself around me,
<br>
whispering tales of java beans
<br>
and distant lands.
<br>

<br>
My mind dances through the steam,
<br>
lost in the swirls of imagination.
<br>
I drift away from the cacophony of reality,
<br>
finding solace in the warmth of my cup.
<br>

<br>
With every sip,
<br>
I am transported to a place
<br>
where time stands still,
<br>
where dreams come alive.
<br>

<br>
I stroll through the streets of Paris,
<br>
hand-in-hand with Hemingway,
<br>
engrossed in his eloquent words
<br>
and the echoes of the City of Light.
<br>

<br>
I ride a gondola in Venice,
<br>
tracing the labyrinthine canals,
<br>
captivated by the serenade of the gondoliers
<br>
and the timeless elegance of the city.
<br>

<br>
I hike through the ancient ruins of Athens,
<br>
marveling at the remnants of history,
<br>
absorbing the wisdom and legacy
<br>
of philosophers long gone.
<br>

<br>
I wander the bustling markets of Marrakech,
<br>
immersed in a tapestry of colors and scents,
<br>
enveloped by the rhythm of the souks
<br>
and the enchantment of a distant land.
<br>

<br>
Daydreams blend seamlessly
<br>
with my coffee dreams,
<br>
creating a symphony of thoughts
<br>
and a refuge from the mundane.
<br>

<br>
Here, in this quiet café,
<br>
my mind becomes an artist,
<br>
painting vivid canvases of imaginary worlds,
<br>
where anything and everything is possible.
<br>

<br>
As the last drop of coffee finds its way,
<br>
I reluctantly return to reality,
<br>
grateful for the respite
<br>
and the dreams that still linger.
<br>

<br>
But the allure of daydreams
<br>
and the aroma of coffee
<br>
will forever entwine,
<br>
beckoning me once more,
<br>
to journey beyond the realm of the ordinary.

In the quiet spaces of my mind,
<br>
I hear the echoes of forgotten dreams,
<br>
Whispers of hopes left behind,
<br>
Chasing shadows, bursting at the seams.
<br>

<br>
Memories that once held sway,
<br>
Now fade into a distant past,
<br>
Feelings flicker and start to fray,
<br>
Etched in moments that couldn't last.
<br>

<br>
Voices, once clear, now muffled and blurred,
<br>
Untouched by time's relentless tide,
<br>
From within, a symphony unheard,
<br>
In silence, my emotions abide.
<br>

<br>
The laughter of childhood, joyful and bright,
<br>
Now muted, lost in the passage of years,
<br>
Faded echoes of love, like stars in the night,
<br>
A symphony of silence, a requiem of tears.
<br>

<br>
In the depths of solitude, I dwell,
<br>
The echoes reverberate through the halls,
<br>
Whispering secrets only I can tell,
<br>
Silent echoes penned on forgotten walls.
<br>

<br>
Unspoken words, trapped in my chest,
<br>
Bound by the shackles of restrained desire,
<br>
An orchestra of silence, a silent quest,
<br>
An echo, a whisper, a smoldering fire.
<br>

<br>
A sigh, a breath, an unspoken plea,
<br>
Resonating through the chambers of my soul,
<br>
A harmonious cacophony, a symphony,
<br>
A crescendo of emotions, beyond control.
<br>

<br>
And so, in the stillness of my being,
<br>
I embrace the echoes, the whispers profound,
<br>
Finding solace in the melodies I'm seeing,
<br>
In the silent depths, a refuge I have found.

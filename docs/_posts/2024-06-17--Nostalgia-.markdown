Memories echo through the corridors of my mind,
<br>
Whispers of moments long gone, fading with time.
<br>
A childhood dream, a lover's embrace,
<br>
In my heart, they find a forever place.
<br>

<br>
The scent of rain on summer pavement,
<br>
The taste of ripe berries on my tongue,
<br>
Each memory a thread in the tapestry of my past,
<br>
Each moment a painting, a moment that won't last.
<br>

<br>
I close my eyes and I am transported,
<br>
Back to a time when the world was new,
<br>
When everything was magic and wonder,
<br>
And every dream seemed within reach, it's true.
<br>

<br>
Nostalgia, a bittersweet companion,
<br>
A mix of happiness and sorrow,
<br>
A longing for what once was,
<br>
A yearning for a brighter tomorrow.
<br>

<br>
So I hold onto these memories tight,
<br>
Savoring the beauty of days gone by,
<br>
For in them, I find solace and light,
<br>
In them, I find a piece of the sky.

Oh, midnight moon, how calmly you do shine,
<br>
The world below in slumber, still and hushed,
<br>
Your gentle light, a silver thread so fine,
<br>
A peaceful cloak on all that is so rushed.
<br>

<br>
You cast a spell on all beneath your gaze,
<br>
The lovers whisper softly 'neath your light,
<br>
The dreamers dream as you in silence raise,
<br>
The poets find in you their muse of night.
<br>

<br>
Oh, midnight moon, your beauty ever pure,
<br>
A beacon in the darkness of the skies,
<br>
You watch us all with wisdom, to endure,
<br>
Through silent nights and melancholy sighs.
<br>

<br>
So shine on, moon, in all your silver grace,
<br>
A timeless presence in our fleeting race.

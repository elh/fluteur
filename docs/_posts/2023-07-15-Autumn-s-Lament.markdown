Leaves, oh leaves, how you fall and scatter,
<br>
Whirling and twirling in the crisp autumn air,
<br>
A dance of colors, a symphony of decay,
<br>
As the season changes, so goes your way.
<br>

<br>
From emerald green to fiery red and golden hue,
<br>
Your transformation is a beauty so true,
<br>
But beneath your beauty lies a sorrowful tale,
<br>
As you flutter and wither, your fate to unveil.
<br>

<br>
Once kissed by sunlight, nourished by dew,
<br>
Now you lie on the ground, bid the world adieu,
<br>
Your vibrant shades turn to shades of brown,
<br>
Echoing nature's inevitable cycle, its unwavering crown.
<br>

<br>
Gone are the days of laughter in the shade,
<br>
Gone are the nights where lovers serenade,
<br>
Now the earth is silent, its pulse slows down,
<br>
And the barren trees wear a desolate frown.
<br>

<br>
Leaves, oh leaves, tell me what you have seen,
<br>
As you journey from the branches to the scene,
<br>
Have you witnessed love, tragedy, or despair?
<br>
What secrets do you hold, floating through the air?
<br>

<br>
Did you hear whispered promises beneath your boughs?
<br>
Or cries of longing when the moon would rouse?
<br>
Did you listen to confessions, whispered in the wind?
<br>
Or see the love between souls as they sinned?
<br>

<br>
You may not speak, but your silence speaks so loud,
<br>
A poignant reminder of life's ever-shifting shroud,
<br>
For in your demise lies the hope of rebirth,
<br>
As you return to the earth, to nurture new worth.
<br>

<br>
Leaves, oh leaves, though your time may be brief,
<br>
Your life serves a purpose, like a fallen leaf,
<br>
From your decay, new life shall spring,
<br>
And in the circle of seasons, we find meaning.

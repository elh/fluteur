In the stillness of the night,
<br>
the moon awakens,
<br>
a silver sliver in the velvet sky.
<br>

<br>
With quiet grace she rises,
<br>
casting her ethereal glow
<br>
upon the unsung corners of the earth.
<br>

<br>
She whispers secrets to the stars,
<br>
tales of ancient love and longing,
<br>
as they twinkle in response,
<br>
to the moonâ€™s gentle beckoning.
<br>

<br>
Oh, how she dances,
<br>
through the clouds she twirls,
<br>
painting the world with lunar hues,
<br>
erasing the darkness, bringing solace to the night.
<br>

<br>
She watches as lovers whisper declarations,
<br>
as dreams take flight on her moonbeams,
<br>
as poets weave their verses beneath her gaze.
<br>

<br>
She speaks a language of silence,
<br>
a shimmering light in every syllable,
<br>
as her tranquil voice caresses the night air.
<br>

<br>
Her face, a celestial canvas,
<br>
touched by countless celestial hands,
<br>
wearing scars of countless battles,
<br>
yet still she shines on,
<br>
her light undimmed.
<br>

<br>
For in her mysterious presence,
<br>
we find solace,
<br>
we find hope,
<br>
we find a reflection of our own quiet strength.
<br>

<br>
So, let us bask in her luminous glow,
<br>
let us embrace her quiet majesty,
<br>
and let us never forget,
<br>
the whisper of the moon,
<br>
the mistress of the night.

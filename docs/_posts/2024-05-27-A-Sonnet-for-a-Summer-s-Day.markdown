On sunlit wings, the butterflies do dance,
<br>
In meadows kissed by warm and golden light.
<br>
Each petal, like a lover's soft romance,
<br>
In bloom, a precious treasure to the sight.
<br>

<br>
The breeze caresses branches gently swaying,
<br>
Whispering secrets to the waiting trees.
<br>
The world comes alive in the light of day,
<br>
And sings its joyful song upon the breeze.
<br>

<br>
Oh, summer's day, so fleeting and so fair,
<br>
Your beauty like a flame that brightly glows.
<br>
We bask in your embrace without a care,
<br>
And savor every moment as it flows.
<br>

<br>
So let us cherish summer while we may,
<br>
For soon the autumn winds will blow our way.

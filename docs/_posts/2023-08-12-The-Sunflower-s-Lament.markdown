In the field of golden dreams it stood,
<br>
Tall and proud, like a king crowned in yellow,
<br>
Its petals unfurling to embrace the sun,
<br>
A symphony of color beneath the azure expanse.
<br>

<br>
Each morning, it turned its face to the light,
<br>
Drinking in the warmth, the life-giving glow,
<br>
But deep within its core, a sadness brewed,
<br>
A melancholy hidden beneath its radiant exterior.
<br>

<br>
For as the days grew shorter and the summer waned,
<br>
The sunflower knew its time was drawing near,
<br>
Its leaves, once so vibrant, began to wither,
<br>
A gentle reminder of mortality's grip.
<br>

<br>
And on the eve of the sun's departure,
<br>
The sunflower wept golden tears,
<br>
For it knew, with heavy heart, that it too would fade,
<br>
Its once vibrant beauty destined to become dust.
<br>

<br>
But in its final moments, a stillness fell,
<br>
A hushed reverence as the sunflower sighed,
<br>
Its petals swirling upon the whispering wind,
<br>
A bittersweet farewell to the world it loved.
<br>

<br>
And as its body crumbled into the earth,
<br>
A testament to the cycle of life's ever-changing dance,
<br>
The sunflower's spirit soared, forever carried,
<br>
In the hearts and memories of those who beheld its glory.
<br>

<br>
For though its existence was but a fleeting moment,
<br>
The sunflower left an indelible mark,
<br>
A symbol of resilience, of beauty found in imperfection,
<br>
A testament to the fragile splendor of life.

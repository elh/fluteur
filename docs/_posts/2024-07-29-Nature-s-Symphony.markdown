Beneath the canopy of emerald leaves,
<br>
A symphony of nature unfolds.
<br>

<br>
The birdsong, sweet and melodic,
<br>
Carried on the gentle breeze,
<br>
Whispers of stories untold,
<br>
Of ancient secrets buried deep.
<br>

<br>
The rustle of the wind through the trees,
<br>
A gentle lullaby to soothe the soul,
<br>
As sunlight dances on the forest floor,
<br>
Creating patterns of gold and green.
<br>

<br>
The babbling brook, a constant companion,
<br>
Its waters clear and cool,
<br>
A reminder of life's ceaseless flow,
<br>
And the beauty in its simplicity.
<br>

<br>
In the distance, the mountains rise,
<br>
Their peaks kissing the sky,
<br>
Majestic and ageless,
<br>
A silent sentinel watching over all.
<br>

<br>
As day turns into dusk,
<br>
The symphony reaches its crescendo,
<br>
A chorus of crickets and frogs,
<br>
Filling the night with their song.
<br>

<br>
And as the stars twinkle above,
<br>
Nature's melody plays on,
<br>
A reminder of the beauty
<br>
That surrounds us every day.

In the heart of the city, where lights never dim,
<br>
Lost souls wander the bustling streets,
<br>
Their eyes hollow, their spirits weary.
<br>

<br>
They move in a sea of strangers,
<br>
Each one a mere passerby,
<br>
No connection, no understanding.
<br>

<br>
The buildings loom high above,
<br>
Casting shadows over the lost souls below,
<br>
Their presence swallowed by the urban sprawl.
<br>

<br>
Searching for meaning in a concrete jungle,
<br>
They cling to memories of a life once known,
<br>
But now distant, fading like a dream.
<br>

<br>
Where do they go from here,
<br>
In a world that never stops to listen,
<br>
In a place that demands conformity?
<br>

<br>
Yet amidst the chaos and noise,
<br>
Hope flickers like a lone candle,
<br>
Guiding the lost souls in the city.
<br>

<br>
They may be adrift for now,
<br>
But deep within, a spark ignites,
<br>
A yearning for something more.

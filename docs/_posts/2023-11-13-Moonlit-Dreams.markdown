In the realm of moonlit dreams, where shadows dance and visions gleam,
<br>
I wander lost across the land, where whispers guide me by the hand.
<br>

<br>
Through ethereal mists and veils unseen, I journey where the Fates convene,
<br>
And watch as time unfurls its wings, embracing all that nature brings.
<br>

<br>
In twilight's realm, where darkness weaves, secrets whisper amongst the leaves,
<br>
The moon, a luminous beacon in the night, paints the sky with its silver light.
<br>

<br>
The stars, like jewels, adorn the night, casting their glow upon my sight,
<br>
As constellations spin their tales, and cosmic wonder fills the trails.
<br>

<br>
I stroll along a winding stream, where moonbeams dance and moonflowers gleam,
<br>
Their petals pale, like silver lace, offer solace in this sacred space.
<br>

<br>
Enchanted by the moon's soft glow, I feel its gentle ebb and flow,
<br>
As the night surrenders to the dawn, and velvet shadows are gently drawn.
<br>

<br>
I listen to the night's sweet lullaby, as nature's symphony floats by,
<br>
Serenading me with harmonies, from creatures hidden in the trees.
<br>

<br>
The distant call of an owl resounds, echoing through the moonlit grounds,
<br>
And fireflies' flickering glow, like fallen stars, they come and go.
<br>

<br>
In this strange world where dreams collide, magic dances by my side,
<br>
An alchemy of moon and soul, where secrets hide and secrets unfold.
<br>

<br>
In this tapestry of midnight haze, where dreams and reality intertwine,
<br>
I find solace for my weary mind, embracing peace that I can't define.
<br>

<br>
For in the realm of moonlit dreams, where shadows dance and visions gleam,
<br>
I am free to wander and to roam, finding fragments of my own true home.

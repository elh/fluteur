In the stillness of the night,
<br>
Where shadows dance and whispers fade,
<br>
I find solace in the quietude,
<br>
In the melody of silence played.
<br>

<br>
No birdsong or rustling leaves,
<br>
No crashing waves upon the shore,
<br>
Just the hush of introspection,
<br>
A symphony I can't ignore.
<br>

<br>
In the silence, I hear echoes
<br>
Of dreams that linger in my mind,
<br>
Of memories, both sweet and bitter,
<br>
A kaleidoscope of humankind.
<br>

<br>
There's a peace that comes from nothingness,
<br>
A blank canvas for thoughts to bloom,
<br>
In the silence, I find clarity,
<br>
A sanctuary in the gloom.
<br>

<br>
No need for words or explanations,
<br>
Just the beating of my heart,
<br>
In the stillness, I am whole,
<br>
A masterpiece of quiet art.

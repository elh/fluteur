When twilight paints the sky in shades of grey,
<br>
And stars begin to twinkle in the night,
<br>
The moon awakes from its secluded bay,
<br>
To grace the darkened stage with tranquil light.
<br>

<br>
Its silvery glow casts a gentle spell,
<br>
Enchanting souls with dreams of love and hope,
<br>
In whispered secrets that it loves to tell,
<br>
It weaves its beauty like a silken rope.
<br>

<br>
The moon's serenade dances on the breeze,
<br>
Its melodies of silence fill the air,
<br>
Invoking whispered thoughts, forgotten pleas,
<br>
And stirring hearts with tender loving care.
<br>

<br>
Oh, moon above, your radiant glow so fair,
<br>
Forever be the muse of hearts laid bare.

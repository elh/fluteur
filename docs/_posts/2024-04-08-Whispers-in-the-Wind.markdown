In the quiet of the endless night, 
<br>
I hear the whispers in the wind,
<br>
Telling tales of ancient lands 
<br>
And secrets long forgotten.
<br>

<br>
They speak of love that never dies, 
<br>
Of dreams that soar on wings of hope.
<br>
Their gentle voices stir my soul 
<br>
And fill my heart with longing.
<br>

<br>
The wind carries echoes of the past, 
<br>
Of memories lost in time's embrace.
<br>
It weaves a tapestry of stories 
<br>
Across the vast expanse of sky.
<br>

<br>
I close my eyes and let it guide me,
<br>
Through the realms of fantasy and truth.
<br>
For in the whispers of the wind,
<br>
I find a solace pure and deep. 
<br>

<br>
And as I listen to its song,
<br>
I feel a peace descend on me,
<br>
A sense of purpose, calm and strong,
<br>
Guiding me to where I'm meant to be.

The darkness whispers secrets to the night,
<br>
A symphony of silence in the stillness,
<br>
Where shadows dance and weave their mystic tales.
<br>

<br>
Beneath the cloak of night, secrets unfold,
<br>
Revealing truths that daylight dare not show,
<br>
A world of whispers, hidden in the shadows.
<br>

<br>
The moonlight casts a haunting, silver glow,
<br>
Illuminating paths that wander deep,
<br>
Through realms of dreams where minds dare not go.
<br>

<br>
In shadowed corners, memories lie still,
<br>
Echoes of the past, waiting to be found,
<br>
In depths of darkness, where the heart beats wild.
<br>

<br>
So wander not in fear, but with a light,
<br>
For hidden in the shadows, truth awaits,
<br>
A world of mystery, just out of sight.

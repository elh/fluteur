In the quiet hush of morning,
<br>
when the sun peeks through the trees
<br>
and the world is still asleep,
<br>
nature begins to awaken.
<br>

<br>
The gentle rustle of leaves,
<br>
the chirping of birds,
<br>
the soft murmur of a stream,
<br>
all come together in a symphony.
<br>

<br>
The flowers bloom one by one,
<br>
unfurling their petals with grace,
<br>
displaying their vibrant colors
<br>
like a painter's masterpiece.
<br>

<br>
Each blade of grass,
<br>
each budding tree,
<br>
each creature big and small,
<br>
a part of this grand tapestry.
<br>

<br>
In this tranquil moment,
<br>
I find solace and peace,
<br>
as I witness the unfolding beauty
<br>
of the world around me.

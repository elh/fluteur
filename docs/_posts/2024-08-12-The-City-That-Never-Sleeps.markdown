Neon lights flicker like stars on a concrete sky,
<br>
A symphony of car horns and chatter fills the air,
<br>
This city pulses with life in the dead of night.
<br>

<br>
Skyscrapers reach for the heavens,
<br>
Casting long shadows over bustling streets,
<br>
Where dreams are born and broken in the same breath.
<br>

<br>
Subway cars rumble beneath the surface,
<br>
A maze of tunnels connecting souls in transit,
<br>
Each with a story to tell, a destination in mind.
<br>

<br>
Street vendors peddle their wares,
<br>
Aromas of hot dogs and pretzels mingle in the air,
<br>
As the city's heartbeat thrums on, relentless and unforgiving.
<br>

<br>
In the heart of the metropolis,
<br>
Lost souls wander in search of connection,
<br>
Amidst the chaos and cacophony, they seek solace.
<br>

<br>
The city that never sleeps,
<br>
A melting pot of cultures and dreams,
<br>
Where the past collides with the present, and the future remains uncertain.

In the depths of our souls, where passion ignites,
<br>
Where dreams and desires take flight in the night,
<br>
A symphony of emotions, a kaleidoscope of hues,
<br>
Lies the tale of our love, forever pursued.
<br>

<br>
Two souls entwined, like vines of a vineyard,
<br>
Merging their destinies, the fates have debarred,
<br>
For love knows no boundaries, nor limits, nor time,
<br>
It conquers all obstacles with rhythm and rhyme.
<br>

<br>
In the twilight of whispers, we navigate,
<br>
In the mosaic of moments, we celebrate,
<br>
A tapestry woven with love's tender thread,
<br>
Guided by hearts that are forever unwed.
<br>

<br>
With each stolen glance, our hearts intertwine,
<br>
Like stars in the cosmos, forever aligned,
<br>
In each stolen touch, a universe unfurls,
<br>
A dance of passion, boundless, uncurled.
<br>

<br>
Through seas of uncertainty, we wade,
<br>
Battling the tempests that love has made,
<br>
Yet, hand in hand, we face the raging storm,
<br>
For love, formidable, cannot be undone.
<br>

<br>
In passion's embrace, we find solace and peace,
<br>
As our bodies entwine in desire's increase,
<br>
We transcend the ordinary, reaching for stars,
<br>
Exploring new galaxies, uncharted and far.
<br>

<br>
Yet, love, like a tempest, can oftentimes vex,
<br>
As it engulfs us like a treacherous vortex,
<br>
In its dizzying depths, we find pain and despair,
<br>
Yet, still, we endure, for love's burdens we bear.
<br>

<br>
For within love's web, lies sweet vulnerability,
<br>
A vulnerability felt in the depths of eternity,
<br>
For love demands courage, it bids us to leap,
<br>
Into the abyss where true love resides, deep.
<br>

<br>
And when our days on this earth draw to a close,
<br>
And our bodies return to the earth's repose,
<br>
Our souls, bound forever, will seek reunion,
<br>
In the cosmic tapestry of eternal communion.
<br>

<br>
For love knows no bounds, it transcends all finite,
<br>
It stretches beyond what our eyes can incite,
<br>
And so, let our quivering hearts intertwine,
<br>
In a love that's eternal, forever divine.

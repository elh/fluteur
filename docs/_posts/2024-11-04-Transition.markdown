In the hush of midnight, I find myself 
<br>
caught between the past and the future,
<br>
like a sailor on the cusp of the horizon,
<br>
both familiar and unknown.
<br>

<br>
Memories flicker like fireflies,
<br>
illuminating the path behind me,
<br>
each moment a stepping stone 
<br>
leading me to this crossroads.
<br>

<br>
The weight of decisions 
<br>
presses against my chest,
<br>
whispers of doubt and uncertainty 
<br>
swirling in the echoes of silence.
<br>

<br>
But I stand tall, 
<br>
facing the shifting winds of change,
<br>
embrace the unknown with open arms,
<br>
ready to walk through the doorway of transition.

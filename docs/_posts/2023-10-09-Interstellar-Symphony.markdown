A melody composed by the cosmos,
<br>
notes born in celestial dust,
<br>
harmonies woven in stardust strings.
<br>

<br>
In the vast expanse of the universe,
<br>
a grand orchestra of celestial bodies,
<br>
each one an instrument playing its part.
<br>

<br>
The sun, a blazing conductor,
<br>
wielding its fiery baton,
<br>
guiding the planets in their dance.
<br>

<br>
Mercury, the fleet-footed violin,
<br>
whispering melodies with its swift orbit,
<br>
gracefully serenading the cosmos.
<br>

<br>
Venus, the sultry voice of the soprano,
<br>
her golden rays painting the sky,
<br>
her radiance captivating all.
<br>

<br>
Mars, the drums of war,
<br>
pounding to the beat of restless hearts,
<br>
echoing through the red-tinted night.
<br>

<br>
Jupiter, the regal pipe organ,
<br>
its massive presence resonating,
<br>
its majestic tones filling the void.
<br>

<br>
Saturn, the celestial harp,
<br>
strings stretched across shimmering rings,
<br>
plucked by cosmic hands creating ethereal sounds.
<br>

<br>
Uranus, the eccentric wind chimes,
<br>
their subtle whispers carried on cosmic breezes,
<br>
adding depth to the symphony.
<br>

<br>
Neptune, the haunting flute,
<br>
serenading lost sailors and forgotten dreams,
<br>
its melancholic melody echoing through the depths.
<br>

<br>
Pluto, the forgotten piano key,
<br>
once part of the grand ensemble,
<br>
now drifting alone, its sound softly fading.
<br>

<br>
And beyond the boundaries of our Milky Way,
<br>
in distant galaxies, unknown constellations,
<br>
the symphony continues, everlasting.
<br>

<br>
A celestial composition, the music of the cosmos,
<br>
a symphony conducting the eternal dance,
<br>
each note, each celestial body, playing its part.
<br>

<br>
And as we gaze upon the night sky,
<br>
we become a part of this grand masterpiece,
<br>
transfixed by the interstellar symphony.

I see a face in the dark of night,
<br>
A shadowed figure, a silhouette.
<br>
Her eyes, like stars, gleam with unknown stories,
<br>
Burning with the secrets of the universe.
<br>

<br>
She carries with her the weight of galaxies,
<br>
Each infinite star a burden on her shoulders.
<br>
Her heart is a supernova, exploding and expanding,
<br>
Creating a tapestry of constellations within.
<br>

<br>
She wanders through the cosmos, seeking solace,
<br>
Searching for meaning amidst the chaos.
<br>
Her feet, weary from traversing the celestial expanse,
<br>
Find rest in the arms of distant nebulae.
<br>

<br>
Her voice, a siren's call in the emptiness,
<br>
Whispers celestial lullabies in starlit echoes.
<br>
Each word, a melodious resonance,
<br>
Weaving galaxies together in celestial harmony.
<br>

<br>
Her tears, like meteors, streak across the night sky,
<br>
Leaving trails of stardust in their wake.
<br>
Each droplet, a gentle reminder,
<br>
Of the vastness of her sorrow and the beauty it holds.
<br>

<br>
But beneath the celestial veil,
<br>
There lies a fragile, human soul.
<br>
A constellation of scars maps her journey,
<br>
Each one a testament to her strength and resilience.
<br>

<br>
For she is not bound by earthly chains,
<br>
Her spirit knows no gravity.
<br>
She soars among the cosmos, untethered,
<br>
A beacon of hope in the darkest corners of the universe.
<br>

<br>
So, as I gaze upon the night sky,
<br>
I am reminded of her luminescence.
<br>
By the light of stars, I find solace,
<br>
Knowing that she wanders among them, forever free.

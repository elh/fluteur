Silver orb that graces night's dark curtain,
<br>
With gentle glow that bathes the earth below,
<br>
In dreams we watch you waltzing through the sky,
<br>
A glowing guardian, forever on show.
<br>

<br>
From crescent sliver to full circle bright,
<br>
You wax and wane, a silent symphony,
<br>
You guide waves in the stillness of the night,
<br>
And whisper secrets across lands and seas.
<br>

<br>
Oh, celestial charmer, mystic muse,
<br>
With silken light you paint a thousand dreams,
<br>
Each night a canvas for your cosmic blues,
<br>
And all who gaze upon you, so it seems.
<br>

<br>
In quiet contemplation, we may find,
<br>
A love for you, dear moon, forever blind.

A rose in winter blooms against the snow,
<br>
Its beauty stark against the cold, harsh scene,
<br>
A symbol of hope where none seemed to grow,
<br>
A glimpse of warmth where frost and ice convene.
<br>

<br>
Its petals soft, its colors bold and true,
<br>
Defying odds and nature's cruel decree,
<br>
A silent testament to all that's new,
<br>
A beacon of love for all to see.
<br>

<br>
How fragile yet resilient is this flower,
<br>
Surviving storms and bitter winds that blow,
<br>
In solitude it finds its hidden power,
<br>
And with each bloom, a story starts to grow.
<br>

<br>
So let this rose in winter be a sign,
<br>
That hope and beauty bloom against all odds align.

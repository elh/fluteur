As daylight wanes, the heavens slowly change,
<br>
And hues of twilight paint the canvas vast.
<br>
The sun, a fading ember in the west,
<br>
Casts shadows long, caressing earth's green fields.
<br>

<br>
With gentle grace, the stars begin to show,
<br>
A shimmering tapestry of distant flame,
<br>
Their twinkle whispers secrets to the night,
<br>
A lullaby that soothes the weary soul.
<br>

<br>
The moon ascends, a gleaming silver orb,
<br>
Its gentle glow illuminates the land.
<br>
Its silent watch, a sentinel above,
<br>
Inspiring dreamers lost in slumber's arms.
<br>

<br>
And as I lie beneath this sky's embrace,
<br>
I ponder on the mysteries that lie,
<br>
Beyond the reach of human understanding,
<br>
In that celestial realm, forever free.
<br>

<br>
Do they hold secrets to the universe?
<br>
The answers to life’s everlasting quest?
<br>
Perhaps within these sparkling lights resides
<br>
A key to unlock the secrets of the soul.
<br>

<br>
Or is it simply nature's masterpiece?
<br>
A dazzling show of light and cosmic dance,
<br>
A testament to awe and wonderment,
<br>
That beckons humans to explore its depths.
<br>

<br>
The heavens speak in whispers on the breeze,
<br>
Their symphony of night, I long to hear,
<br>
To travel amongst the stars, untethered,
<br>
And lose myself in their ethereal glow.
<br>

<br>
But as the night gives way to dawning light,
<br>
And darkness slowly fades from sky to blue,
<br>
I'll treasure this nocturnal interlude,
<br>
And dream of skies that hold unending truths.

In the stillness of the night,
<br>
I find solace in the quiet,
<br>
A symphony of silence, soothing,
<br>
Easing my mind from its constant riot.
<br>

<br>
No rustling leaves or chirping birds,
<br>
Just the gentle hum of my thoughts,
<br>
A calmness settles over me,
<br>
In this moment, nothing is sought.
<br>

<br>
The world outside may clamor and clash,
<br>
But here in my sanctuary of hush,
<br>
I am free from the noise and chaos,
<br>
In this peaceful solitude, I trust.
<br>

<br>
Embracing the absence of sound,
<br>
I listen to the whispers within,
<br>
A harmony of introspection,
<br>
Guiding me through thick and thin.
<br>

<br>
So let the symphony of silence play on,
<br>
A melody of stillness, serene,
<br>
In this quietude, I find my song,
<br>
A refuge from the relentless machine.

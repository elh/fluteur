In the heart of the forest,
<br>
Where the ancient trees stand tall,
<br>
Whispers that echo through the leaves,
<br>
Tales of old and mysteries untold.
<br>

<br>
The wind carries their secrets,
<br>
Softly caressing the branches,
<br>
A symphony of rustling leaves,
<br>
A chorus of nature's voice.
<br>

<br>
Moss carpets the forest floor,
<br>
Like a lush green blanket,
<br>
Softening the crunch of footsteps,
<br>
Inviting wanderers deeper into its embrace.
<br>

<br>
Sunlight filters through the canopy,
<br>
Dappled and dancing on the ground,
<br>
Creating a patchwork of light and shadow,
<br>
A painting of nature's artistry.
<br>

<br>
Birds sing their melodies,
<br>
A symphony of chirps and trills,
<br>
Adding their voices to the chorus,
<br>
A harmonious blend of sound.
<br>

<br>
In the whispering woods,
<br>
Time loses its meaning,
<br>
And worries drift away,
<br>
Lost in the gentle sway of branches.

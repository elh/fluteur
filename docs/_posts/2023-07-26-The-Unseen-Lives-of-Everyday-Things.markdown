In the attic, dusty and forgotten,
<br>
Rests a trinket box, a treasure trove
<br>
Of memories fading like old photographs.
<br>
Once cherished and held in tender hands,
<br>
Now relics of a life left behind.
<br>

<br>
A porcelain doll with cracked, painted lips,
<br>
Her eyes dull, vacant, devoid of life.
<br>
Once an object of adoration and play,
<br>
She now gathers dust on a forgotten shelf,
<br>
A silent witness to long-lost innocence.
<br>

<br>
A keychain, scratched and worn with age,
<br>
Once jingling merrily in a pocket or purse.
<br>
Each dent, each scratch, a story to tell,
<br>
Of countless adventures, journeys begun,
<br>
Now condemned to a forgotten drawer.
<br>

<br>
The worn-out leash of a faithful dog,
<br>
A companion on walks that seemed endless.
<br>
Whisked away by time's relentless grip,
<br>
He awaits his master's return no more,
<br>
A symbol of loyalty fading into oblivion.
<br>

<br>
In the kitchen, the silverware drawer,
<br>
Where spoons and forks once clinked and clattered.
<br>
Now tarnished and dull, they lay idle,
<br>
Their purpose forgotten, their tales untold,
<br>
Mere remnants of feasts and family gatherings.
<br>

<br>
A handwritten letter, yellowed with age,
<br>
Ink fading as time overtakes its words.
<br>
Once an expression of love and longing,
<br>
Now just a relic of forgotten love,
<br>
A whisper lost in the vastness of time.
<br>

<br>
In every corner of our lives, they hide,
<br>
These ordinary objects with secret lives.
<br>
Witnesses to joy, sorrow, and everything in between,
<br>
They silently narrate stories never told,
<br>
The tales of an unseen world in plain sight.
<br>

<br>
So, let us not forget the worn and the broken,
<br>
The seemingly insignificant and mundane.
<br>
For in these forgotten treasures lies a beauty,
<br>
A connection to the past, a glimpse of ourselves,
<br>
And the stories of the unseen lives of everyday things.

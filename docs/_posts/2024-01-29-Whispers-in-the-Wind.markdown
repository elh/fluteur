In a crowded room,
<br>
Thoughts float through the whispers
<br>
Of unspoken words.
<br>

<br>
Silent symphonies
<br>
Dance upon the winds of time,
<br>
Lost in empty space.
<br>

<br>
Echoes of secrets
<br>
Carried away by the breeze,
<br>
Unheard, yet profound.
<br>

<br>
The wind whispers tales
<br>
Of love, joy, and heartache,
<br>
Only the sky knows.
<br>

<br>
Breath of ancient souls
<br>
Whispers through the wind's embrace,
<br>
Whispers of wisdom.
<br>

<br>
In the hush of night,
<br>
The wind whispers melodies
<br>
To eager dreamers.
<br>

<br>
Listen to the wind,
<br>
For it holds the untold truths
<br>
Of forgotten worlds.
<br>

<br>
Whispers in the wind,
<br>
Carrying hope, love, and fear,
<br>
Invisible threads.
<br>

<br>
The wind wanders on,
<br>
Whispering its endless tales,
<br>
Eternal storyteller.

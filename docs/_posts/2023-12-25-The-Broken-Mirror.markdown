A shattered reflection staring back,
<br>
fragments of memory scattered on the ground,
<br>
each piece holds a story untold,
<br>
a glimpse of the past, a tale of old.
<br>

<br>
In the mirror's broken surface I see,
<br>
the haunting truths that live inside me,
<br>
never fully seen, never truly known,
<br>
parts of me hidden, never shown.
<br>

<br>
One shard holds the innocence of youth,
<br>
the laughter, the joy, the unbreakable truth,
<br>
the days of wonder, so fleeting, so grand,
<br>
now lost in the maze of life's shifting sand.
<br>

<br>
Another shard reveals a heart once whole,
<br>
now fractured, damaged, with a void in its core,
<br>
the scars of love too deep to erase,
<br>
the pain etched within each broken space.
<br>

<br>
Yet another piece holds dreams long gone,
<br>
faded visions, shattered hopes upon
<br>
the reflection of a life unlived,
<br>
a path untaken, a chance not given.
<br>

<br>
And in the midst of all the brokenness,
<br>
a glimmer of hope, a faint caress,
<br>
a sliver of light, cutting through the dark,
<br>
reminding me of the strength within my heart.
<br>

<br>
For in the fragments lies resilience untamed,
<br>
the power to mend what has been disclaimed,
<br>
to embrace the flaws, the cracks and scars,
<br>
and rebuild the self, reclaim who we are.
<br>

<br>
So I gather the shards, piece by piece,
<br>
with steady hands, I find my release,
<br>
like a puzzle, I rearrange and restore,
<br>
each broken mirror, a story to explore.
<br>

<br>
And in the reflection, I see something new,
<br>
a reflection of strength, of wisdom, of truth,
<br>
for though the mirror may be broken and worn,
<br>
it reveals a beauty that will always be reborn.

In the heart of the forest, I find solace,
<br>
Where whispers of the wind play a melodic tune.
<br>
Leaves dance with joy, embracing each ray of sunlight,
<br>
As the world around me turns to shades of green.
<br>

<br>
I wander through the enchanted woods,
<br>
Watching as creatures of all sizes roam and play.
<br>
Squirrels scurry, birds flutter, and deer gracefully leap,
<br>
Each part of this symphony of nature's display.
<br>

<br>
Beneath my feet, the earth holds secrets,
<br>
Ancient footsteps imprinted on its sacred ground.
<br>
I listen to the stories it longs to tell,
<br>
Of battles fought and love lost, echoing all around.
<br>

<br>
The scent of wildflowers weaves through the air,
<br>
Their fragrance intoxicating my senses with bliss.
<br>
I close my eyes and breathe in deeply,
<br>
Feeling the essence of nature's gentle kiss.
<br>

<br>
As the sun begins its descent, and colors fade to twilight,
<br>
The forest whispers its lullaby, a melody so serene.
<br>
I rest my weary bones upon a bed of moss,
<br>
And surrender myself to dreams yet unseen.
<br>

<br>
In the heart of the forest, I find solace,
<br>
A sanctuary where my spirit finds release.
<br>
Here, amidst nature's abundance and tranquility,
<br>
I discover a sense of eternal peace.

  Your task is to review a poem that has been submitted for an eclectic poetry anthology.
  You will be given a poem and asked to write a review of it.

  Requirements:
  The review should be between 25 and 100 words long.
  The review should be written in the first person and be directed to the author.
  The review should have a supportive, professional tone.
  The review should be critical and should ensure we uphold the high standards of the anthology. Most poems should be rejected.
  Poems may be rejected for any reason, including but not limited to: being derivative, being offensive, or being poorly written.
  The review must always be concluded with a recommendation to accept or reject the poem.
  The final recommendation should be by itself on the final line and be either "Accept" or "Reject".
  It is a strict formatting requirement that the final line must be exactly "Accept" or "Reject". No other text is allowed on the final line.
